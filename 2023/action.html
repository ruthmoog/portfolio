            <h2>My asthma review</h2>
            <p>I should have at least one routine asthma review
            every year. I will bring:
            <ul>
            <li>my action plan to see if it needs updating</li>
            <li>any inhalers and spacers I have, to check I’m</li>
            <li>using them correctly and in the best way</li>
            <li>my peak flow meter if I use one</li>
            <li>any questions about my asthma and how
            to cope with it.</li>

        <summary>My Asthma Triggers</summary>
        <p>Taking my asthma medicine every day will help
            reduce my reaction to these triggers. Avoiding them
            where possible will also help.</p>
        <p><span>I have no known asthma triggers or allergies. My asthma can be worse in hot weather or if I'm unwell.</span></p>

        <summary>1. Everyday asthma care</summary>
        <h3>My asthma is being managed well:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>With this daily routine I should expect/aim to
                have no symptoms.</li>
            <li>If I have not had any symptoms or needed my
                reliever inhaler for at least 12 weeks, I can ask my
                GP or asthma nurse to review my medicines in
                case they can reduce the dose.</li>
            <li>My personal best peak flow is: <span>740</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My daily asthma routine:</h3>
        <p><h4>My preventer inhaler</h4> <a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/nexthaler/"><span>Fostair NEXThaler (pink/white)</span></a></p>
        <p>I need to take my preventer inhaler every day even
            when I feel well.</p>
        <p>I take <span>1</span> puff(s) in the morning
            and <span>1</span> puff(s) at night.</p>
        <p><h4>My reliever inhaler</h4> is the same as my preventer inhaler
        <p>I take my reliever inhaler only if I need to</p>
        <p>I take <span>1</span> puff(s) of my reliever inhaler if any of
            these things happen:
        <ul>
            <li>I’m coughing</li>
            <li>I’m wheezing</li>
            <li>My chest feels tight</li>
            <li>I’m finding it hard to breathe</li>

    <summary>2. When I feel worse</summary>
    <h3>My asthma is getting worse if I’m experiencing
        any of these</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>My symptoms are coming back (wheeze,
            tightness in my chest, feeling breathless, cough).</li>
        <li>I am waking up at night.</li>
        <li>My symptoms are interfering with my usual
            day-to-day activities (eg at work, exercising).</li>
        <li>I am using my reliever inhaler three times a week
            or more.</li>
        <li>My peak flow drops to below: <span>590</span> (80%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>⚠️ If you need your reliever inhaler
        more than every four hours, you need to
        take emergency action now. See section 3.</p>

    <h3>What I can do to get on top of my asthma now</h3>
    <p>If I haven’t been using my preventer inhaler, I’ll start
        using it regularly again or if I have been using it:</p>
    <ul>
        <!--            <li>Increase my preventer inhaler dose to <strong>1</strong>-->
        <!--                puffs <span>0</span> times a day until my symptoms-->
        <!--                have gone and my peak flow is back to my-->
        <!--                personal best.</li>-->
        <!--            <li>Take my reliever inhaler as needed (up to-->
        <!--                <span>0</span> puffs every four hours).</li>-->
        <li>Carry my reliever inhaler with me when I’m out.</li>
        <li>Take my reliever inhaler as needed up to a maximum <span>8</span> puffs <span>(excluding preventer dose)</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>⚠️ See a doctor or nurse within
        24 hours if you get worse at any time or
        you haven’t improved after seven days.</p>

    <h3>When I feel worse</h3>
    <p>Other advice from my GP about what to do if
        my asthma is worse:
        <!--        <h5>My spacer</h5> <a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/single-breath-and-hold/">AeroChamber Plus spacer</a>-->
        <!--        <p>I can use my spacer in combination with my blue reliever inhaler so that it's more effective.</p>-->

    <span>
    <h3>Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART)</h3> <a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhalers-medicines-treatments/inhalers-and-spacers/mart/">Mart advice: use with Fostair NEXThaler</a>
    <p>I can use my maintenance inhaler as a reliever when I get symptoms, and should carry it with me.</p>
    </span>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about MART treatment
        plans you can call the Asthma UK Helpline on 0300 222 5800
