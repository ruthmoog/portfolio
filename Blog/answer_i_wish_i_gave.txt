Why Do You Want To Be A Developer?
The Answer I Wish I Gave At Interview

I had my first cultural tech interview yesterday,
after applying for a fellowship with Makers
Academy. I was asked why I wanted to be a
software engineer. My vague answer - which I
think does me a disservice - is that it's fun.
Cringe.

I've reflected on this question and on why I've
chosen software development over myriad paths
of curiosity.  Here's a more complete answer:
I'm good at it.

What makes _you_ so sure, wise guy?

Non-technical experience is transferable;
Many skills in my previous job apply here,
I'm talking about leadership, communication,
problem solving, planning, project delivery,
workflow optimisation... a programming
career will build on my existing foundation
and on what I've learned through practical
experience.
But, more than this, programming 'clicks' with
my intuition.  I have meticulous attention to 
detail (don't @ me - I've learned not to let
this block my delivery), and I enjoy problem
solving and taking an unusual view of a problem
- outside of the box thinking is useful in a tech
 team! - and this is what I find enjoyable when I
 write programs.

If you're in a similar position and are considering
a career change into tech, reviewing which
aspects of your foundation knowledge and skills
are transferable will help you answer "why?".
Thinking about how I demonstrated these skills in
the past and where my experience could benefit
me more if reframed in a technical context,
helped boost my confidence in my background
and helped draw attention to where I needed to
focus my development.
