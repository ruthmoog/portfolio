Preparing Your Head For A Career Change Into Digital

It's taken 10yrs in my publishing career to earn a
salary comparable to a Junior Developer in London.
This makes a career change feel fairly low risk.
However I don't expect taxing 9-5 days in the
office to be thrilling.
Resilience & self care are hugely important for
minorities in digital careers, including women
and older 'early-career professionals' like me.

I collected some tips for preparing yourself
mentally ahead of launching into a new field.

Be kind to yourself, vary your day and make time
for fun things

work efficiently
create a plan, categorise your tasks to keep your
day varied, and include down-time to keep your
head fresh and keep motivated - might stop you
procrastinating too inniiii

don't look
at twitter, the news, blah.  surround yourself
with positivity instead of misery.  I may believe
in justice and equality and the news is surely outrageous,
but I dont need my focus pulled from my goal.

some tips from other people would be good?

keeping a diary

reflect and review
My last job showed me that I'm resilient.
I know my value.  I'm thankful to have access to
coaches, mentors, blogs, courses and networks
to support my career change & coding journey.
