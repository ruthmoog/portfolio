    <h3>1. Everyday asthma care</h3>
        <h4>My asthma is being managed well:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>With this daily routine I should expect/aim to
                have no symptoms.</li>
            <li>If I have not had any symptoms or needed my
                reliever inhaler for at least 12 weeks, I can ask my
                GP or asthma nurse to review my medicines in
                case they can reduce the dose.</li>
            <li>My personal best peak flow is: <strong>670</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>My daily asthma routine:</h4>
        <p><h5>My preventer inhaler</h5> <a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/turbohaler/">Symbicort Turbohaler 200/6, white</a></p>
        <p>I need to take my preventer inhaler every day even
        when I feel well.</p>
        <p>I take 2 puff(s) in the morning
        and 2 puff(s) at night.</p>
        <p><h5>My reliever inhaler</h5> <a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/pmdi/">Ventolin Evohaler pMDI 100μg, blue</a></p>
        <p>I take my reliever inhaler only if I need to</p>
        <p>I take 2 puff(s) of my reliever inhaler if any of
        these things happen:
            <ul>
                <li>I’m coughing</li>
                <li>I’m wheezing</li>
                <li>My chest feels tight</li>
                <li>I’m finding it hard to breathe</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h5>Other medicines and devices I use for my asthma every day</h5>

        <h3>2. When I feel worse</h3>
        <h4>My asthma is getting worse if I’m experiencing
            any of these</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My symptoms are coming back (wheeze,
                tightness in my chest, feeling breathless, cough).</li>
            <li>I am waking up at night.</li>
            <li>My symptoms are interfering with my usual
                day-to-day activities (eg at work, exercising).</li>
            <li>I am using my reliever inhaler three times a week
                or more.</li>
<!--            <li>My peak flow drops to below: <strong>TO DO</strong></li>-->
        </ul>

        <h4>What I can do to get on top of my asthma now</h4>
        <p>If I haven’t been using my preventer inhaler, I’ll start
        using it regularly again or if I have been using it:</p>
        <ul>
<!--            <li>Increase my preventer inhaler dose to-->
<!--                puffs times a day until my symptoms-->
<!--                have gone and my peak flow is back to my-->
<!--                personal best.</li>-->
            <li>Take my reliever inhaler as needed (up to
                4 puffs every four hours).</li>
            <li>Carry my reliever inhaler with me when I’m out.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>When I feel worse</h4>
        <p>Other advice from my GP about what to do if
        my asthma is worse:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/single-breath-and-hold/">AeroChamber Plus spacer</a>
                I can use my spacer in combination with my blue reliever inhaler so that it's more effective.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhalers-medicines-treatments/inhalers-and-spacers/mart/">Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART)</a>
                I can use my maintenance inhaler as a reliever when I get symptoms, and should carry it with me.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>⚠️ URGENT! If you need your reliever inhaler
            more than every four hours, you need to
            take emergency action now. See section 3.</p>
        <p>⚠️ URGENT! See a doctor or nurse within
            24 hours if you get worse at any time or
            you haven’t improved after seven days.</p>

        <h3>3. In an asthma attack</h3>
        <h4>I’m having an asthma attack if I’m experiencing any
            of these</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My reliever inhaler is not helping or I need it more
                than every four hours.</li>
            <li>I find it difficult to walk or talk.</li>
            <li>I find it difficult to breathe.</li>
            <li>I’m coughing a lot, or I have a very tight chest,
                or I’m wheezing a lot.</li>
<!--            <li>My peak flow is below: TODO </li>-->
        </ul>
        <h4>What to do in an asthma attack</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Sit up straight - try to keep calm.</li>
            <li>Take one puff of your blue reliever inhaler
                every 30-60 seconds up to 10 puffs.*</li>
            <li>If you feel worse at any point OR you don’t feel better
                after 10 puffs call 999 for an ambulance.</li>
            <li>If the ambulance has not arrived after 10 minutes and
                your symptoms are not improving, repeat step 2.</li>
            <li>If your symptoms are no better after repeating
                step 2, and the ambulance has still not arrived,
                contact 999 again immediately.</li>
        </ol>

            you use a MART inhaler.</p>
        <h4>After an asthma attack</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you dealt with your asthma attack at home,
                see your GP today.</li>
            <li>If you were treated in hospital, see your GP within
                48 hours of being discharged.</li>
            <li>Finish any medicines they prescribe you, even if
                you start to feel better.</li>
            <li>If you don’t improve after treatment, see your

            <li>If you dealt with your asthma attack at work,
