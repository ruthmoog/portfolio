            <h3>Meet Ruth Baker</h3>
            <h1>From Project Manager to Software Engineer</h1>
            <p>Before Makers I worked in science publishing for a decade. I was a Project Coordinator at Springer Nature (2,500 staff)
            doing project management, operations strategy, and working with others (developers, external editors, management…),
            & I trained science editors on how to use the online peer review system</p>
            <details>
                <summary>see more/less...</summary>
                <p>Before that I managed a team for BMC (200 staff) on the BMC series (flagship journals in Biology & Medicine subjects) – all online, open access, making research available for everyone and maintaining integrity in science research. Lots of Excel, data analysis, and a tiny bit of SQL. On top of that I worked in print production for Springer Healthcare (150 staff) with designers and global contractors (printing, & delivery), using lots of print domain specific knowledge.</p>
                <p>For a long time I was the person apologising for problems with the workflow, from now on I want to be on the team solving problems. I enjoy breaking problems down, getting to the bottom of an issue and figuring out a way to solve it. I love the idea that software is always changing, growing with the people who use it. I love love love writing a program that does what you want it to!
                I don’t consider myself a stereotypical developer, so I think it’s really cool that I can have a career where I program for humans not machines
                </p>
                <h2><quote>“I enjoy breaking problems down, getting to the bottom of an issue and figuring out a way to solve it.”</quote></h2>
                <h4>What I’m looking for:</h4>
                <p>My ideal job offers the chance to learn on lots of parts of software development, front/back end, middleware, databases, UX, accessibility – I want to try everything and find where I fit.</p>
                <p>I’d like to work in a team that trusts its developers / demonstrates or wants to grow in XP values, Agile works for them, loves TDD… My dream job uses continuous deployment and isn’t scared to deploy on Fridays.</p>
                <p>My ideal team should see the value in a diversity; creates opportunities for learning, mentorship; and continues their diversity throughout the business.
                Work/life balance is important and I would love to work somewhere that is proven to be kind about human needs.
                I’d like to be able to understand what the company does and believe in their product/values</p>
                <h4>Strengths:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>README Queen: I pay special attention to writing code that can be understood as I want my code to be easy for the next dev to understand and be ‘malleable’.</li>
                    <li>Excellent collaborator (through pair programming) and communicator. Great at giving and receiving feedback!</li>
                    <li>I volunteer at codebar as a moderator and recently joined them as a London organiser. I like to go to meet ups and conferences, I went to CityJS conference during the pre-course and will be going to State of the Browser in Sept.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Codebar Stories</h3>
            <h1>Ruth Baker — Makers Fellow</h1>
            <p>Ruth is a Makers Fellow, transforming her career from science publishing to software development. She built her tech skills through open resources and by attending codebar events in London, and is now a moderator for virtual codebar.</p>
            <p>Ruth lives in Kent, UK, with her partner (also a dev!), and cat Pepper (not a dev!). She is a volunteer for the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, and her other interests include tap dance and ballet.</p>

                <h4>What did you want to be growing up?</h4>
                <p>When I was very young I wanted to be a mounted police officer — get paid to own a horse? Yes please. During my school years I wanted to be a choreographer, and at college I was considering a career as a sound engineer. I went on to work briefly in music events, then worked in STEM publishing for a decade.</p>
                <h4>When did your interest in tech start?</h4>
                <p>I was part of an online music community and I’d seen others making websites and followed their lead. I muddled together HTML pages by exploring view source and finding tips on the web, and I used free web hosts to make websites for my projects. I’d tinker with CSS on myspace. Strangely this loose knowledge was helpful in my non-tech career.</p>
                <p>When I saw the potential that programming could have in my job it gave me a greater interest in learning to code, but the frustration of not being enabled to use tech in my job drove me to change career.</p>
                <h4>How did you make the transition to being a developer?</h4>
                <p>I already knew I had a technical way of thinking that was underused in my job. I spoke to developers, UX designers, tech managers about their jobs, and followed developers on Twitter. I considered transferring to the digital team in my company, but decided enrolling at Makers was a smart route instead. I researched what I needed to join their fellowship and how to make my candidacy watertight. It worked! I worked peripherally for a year or more on improving my coding ability, but I handed in my notice and became focussed on my new career about four months before an opportunity came up to join as a Fellow — all that groundwork meant I was ready to apply as soon as the opportunity arose. I start the Fellowship this month.</p>
                <h4>What was your first development job?</h4>
                <p>A band I followed saw my myspace profile customisation and asked me to customise their myspace page (unpaid) for their record release — so I did… having learnt a thing or two about projects since then, I would not take such an overzealous approach today!</p>
                <p>Actually collaborating with someone is a great way to quantify your skills, find knowledge gaps to guide learning, and practise communication with a client. You might also produce something wonderful to show off in your portfolio.</p>
                <h4>What is your favourite thing about being a developer?</h4>
                <p>The joy from succeeding after being completely stumped on a problem. I can’t be the only person who claps themselves when they’ve made something work correctly?!</p>
                <h4>How did you get involved with codebar?</h4>
                <p>codebar was recommended to me by a colleague. Once I’d focussed on a career change, I chose to be outwardly accountable for my learning, and joining the tech community via codebar was a way to do that. I found that the support and the shared network of the coaches/students is so so valuable, and the hard work the organisers put in to fostering community makes it easy to feel welcome.</p>
                <p>Around the time I left publishing, Charlotte Zhao was starting to grow the virtual codebar with an idea that the community can be open globally and around-the-clock, so I offered to help with the project. Charlotte was happy to have someone share her vision and, I’m glad I volunteered!</p>
                <h4>Why do you keep coming back to codebar?</h4>
                <p>It’s fun, rewarding and an effective way to grow skills. Aside from working towards a coding goal, just by pairing with someone you can learn cool keyboard shortcuts and become a better technical communicator. At irl meetups you get a peek at the work environment at companies like Google and Deliveroo too. At virtual sessions you can have a remote working experience, and try out conferencing tools.</p>
                <h4>What are your plans for the future?</h4>
                <p>When I finish Makers I’ll have a full-time developer role for at least a year with a corporate partner. That first job after completing the course will be full-on, and I intend to get experience across as much technology as humanly possible during that time. I will continue to learn the trade and refine my technique within my team, and later in whatever projects I end up working on down the line. Part of the ethos of being a developer is sharing, and coaching others is part of that. It’s exciting to think I can give others a leg-up and help make the tech environment more diverse and inclusive.</p>
                <h4>What advice would you give to aspiring developers?</h4>
                <p>Trust yourself — You know what path is right for you; let yourself be supported by the tech community; do your best.</p>
                <p>Know your direction — Speak to people about their jobs, their team, their experience; ask yourself if you’re comfortable being a lifelong student; do good, be forward thinking, be kind.</p>
                <p>Make things — Get set up and start making real things, it works wonders!</p>
                <h4>What is the bravest thing you’ve ever done?</h4>
                <p>I don’t think I am brave, but I have done some pretty fun things! As a dancer, I’ve performed at a French cabaret, improvised with live jazz bands in New York and London, and shared a stage with Dizzee Rascal and Tim Berners-Lee at the London Olympics (weird but true…). I am guarded about strangers seeing my shopping at the supermarket checkout, so that’s quite an achievement, isn’t it? :)</p>
