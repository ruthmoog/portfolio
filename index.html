        <h2>Hi, I'm Ruth and I make software.</h2>
        <p>I'm a full stack developer whose focus is on Ruby, HTML and CSS - as a life-long learner I can put my head to anything!  With a love of open-source and accessibility, <strong>I want to build great software, and work with the best engineers in forward thinking teams</strong>.  I live in the UK with a cat named Pepper and a partner who goes by qui.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I'm a Fellow at <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a> preparing to embark on a professional corporate placement.</p>

        <h3>For everyone.</h3>
        <p>I believe in accessibility as a core principle when creating software, and this is something I keep in mind as I code.  My digital community values diversity, collaboration, openness and reflection; its developers build relevant, satisfying software that's easy for everyone to use.<br />
        On the web's 30th birthday, to demonstrate my support of the principles for an open web for everyone I signed the World Wide Web Foundation's <a href="https://fortheweb.webfoundation.org/principles">Contract for the Web</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Bringing work to life.</h3>
        <p>I volunteer for the <a href="https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a> as a Bee Walker.  The Trust coordinates a citizen science project where non-scientists (like me!) collect data on the abundance of bee species throughout the UK.  Taking part gives me the opportunity to explore the wildlife where I live and identify beautiful chunky bees!  My enthusiasm for bumblebees has inspired programs and websites.  By joining my passions I can bring my work to life.<br />

        <h3>More than a developer.</h3>
        <p>Before I became a developer, I worked in STEM publishing as an operations team lead, and a project coordinator for print and digital products.  Throughout my decade-long career with major publishing groups, I remained committed to quality and function. My experience makes me more than a developer, with a strong background outside of technology.</p>
