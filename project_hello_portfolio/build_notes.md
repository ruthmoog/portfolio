## Hello, Portfolio! write up notes

# First iteration

 - Did an audit and had to review contrast for accessibility, refer to webAIM guidelines
 - DONE: Also update font-size in the footer to min 12px
 - Took a screenshot of the first version of the audit :)

# Also to improve iteratively...

 - hover over changes img
 - responsive design, flexbox layout?
 - add more pages

# Accessibility is kinda hard...

 - you can use the WAVE tool from webAIM to get advice http://wave.webaim.org
