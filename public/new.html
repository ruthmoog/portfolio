        <h2>Hi, I'm Ruth and I make software.</h2>
            <p>I'm a software engineer with training and experience in Java, Ruby and JavaScript, pair programming, Agile, XP Values, and self-directed learning - as a life-long learner I can put my head to anything!  With a love of open-source and accessibility, <strong>I want to build great software, and work with the best engineers in forward thinking teams</strong>. I live in the UK with a cat named Pepper and a partner who goes by quii.</p>
            <p>I'm an engineer with <a href="https://www.alfasystems.com/">Alfa</a>, working mainly with Java.  I'm active in Alfa's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives, including the Environmental Impact Team.</p>
            <!--        <p>I volunteer with <a href="https://www.codebar.io">codebar</a>, a charity which facilitates a diverse tech community through programming workshops. I've volunteered as an Organiser and Moderator, and participated as a Student!</p>-->
            <p>In May 2019 I was awarded a fellowship at <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>.</p>

        <h3>For everyone.</h3>
            <p>I believe in accessibility as a core principle when creating software, and this is something I keep in mind as I code.  My digital community values diversity, collaboration, openness and reflection; its developers build relevant, satisfying software that's easy for everyone to use.</p>
            <p>On the web's 30th birthday, to demonstrate my support of the principles for an open web for everyone I signed the World Wide Web Foundation's <a href="https://fortheweb.webfoundation.org/principles">Contract for the Web</a>.
                In my capacity as a professional developer, I promise to abide by the ethical principles stated in the <a href="https://manifesto.responsiblesoftware.org/">Manifesto for Responsible Software Development</a>.</p>
        <h3>Bringing work to life.</h3>
            <p>I volunteer for the <a href="https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a> as a Bee Walker.  The Trust coordinates a citizen science project where non-scientists (like me!) collect data on the abundance of bee species throughout the UK.  Taking part gives me the opportunity to explore the wildlife where I live and identify beautiful chunky bees!  My enthusiasm for bumblebees has inspired programs and websites.  By joining my passions I can bring my work to life.</p>
            <p>Interested in bumblebee conservation?  <a href="https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/getinvolved">Find out how to get involved</a>.</p>
        <h3>More than a developer.</h3>
            <p>Before I became a developer, I worked in STEM publishing as an operations team lead, and a project coordinator for print and digital products.  Throughout my decade-long career with major publishing groups, I remained committed to quality and function. My experience makes me more than a developer, with a strong background outside of technology.</p>

            <h2>User Manual.</h2>
                <p>I've created my own 'user manual' to help you discover more about me. I used <a href="https://www.manualof.me/">Manual of Me</a> for inspiration; it's a tool to create a handy guide on how you work, for sharing with others.</p>
            <h3>üîë Key facts:</h3>
                <p><span class="emoji">üí° </span> I'm an early career developer, employed as a Software Engineer.</p>
                <p><span class="emoji">üí¨ </span> My pronouns are she/her.</p>
                <p><span class="emoji">üéì </span> I'm a bootcamp grad, specifically a Makers Fellow Alumna.</p>

            <h3>üëãüèª Introducing me...</h3>
                <p>The thing that fills me with passion and energy to get cracking in the morning, is knowing what I need to achieve next and how I can get started.</p>
                <p>What motivates me to come into work each day is knowing I have support from my team, and we can all have a productive and stress-free day.</p>
                <p>A good way to socialise with me would be in a quiet cafe. I don't enjoy standing in a crowded pub, but I love a good pub quiz. </p>
                <p>The main coding language I use for my job is Java.</p>

            <h3>üå± Levelling up...</h3>
                <p>I work at levelling-up by reading technical books, attending online conferences, and using my skills to help teach other people to code.</p>
                <p>I like coaches to assume that I have little knowledge but infinite intelligence.</p>
                <p>My main career goal is to be a great developer! I've been a manager before, but right now I want to concentrate on code instead of leading a team.</p>

            <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Working together...</h3>
                <p>One thing I love about pair programming is collaboration, I find talking through a process rewarding, although it's also exhausting, so time to recharge is important for me, too.</p>
                <p>I usually work remotely from home, and my current work days are Mon-Thu.</p>
                <p>I'm happy to jump on a video call with colleagues, just DM me a heads-up first or book something in the calendar.</p>
                <p>The best way to give me feedback is with specific examples rather than general observations. I prefer to be asked for input than given solutions.</p>
                <p>In an ideal future, it would be easy for my team to be productive, because we can commit changes safely and quickly.</p>

        <h3>Meet Ruth Baker</h3>
        <h1>From Project Manager to Software Engineer</h1>
            <p>Before Makers I worked in science publishing for a decade. I was a Project Coordinator at Springer Nature (2,500 staff)
            doing project management, operations strategy, and working with others (developers, external editors, management‚Ä¶),
            & I trained science editors on how to use the online peer review system</p>
            <details>
                <summary>see more/less...</summary>
                            <p>Before that I managed a team for BMC (200 staff) on the BMC series (flagship journals in Biology & Medicine subjects) ‚Äì all online, open access, making research available for everyone and maintaining integrity in science research. Lots of Excel, data analysis, and a tiny bit of SQL. On top of that I worked in print production for Springer Healthcare (150 staff) with designers and global contractors (printing, & delivery), using lots of print domain specific knowledge.</p>
                            <p>For a long time I was the person apologising for problems with the workflow, from now on I want to be on the team solving problems. I enjoy breaking problems down, getting to the bottom of an issue and figuring out a way to solve it. I love the idea that software is always changing, growing with the people who use it. I love love love writing a program that does what you want it to!
                                I don‚Äôt consider myself a stereotypical developer, so I think it‚Äôs really cool that I can have a career where I program for humans not machines</p>
                            <h2><quote>‚ÄúI enjoy breaking problems down, getting to the bottom of an issue and figuring out a way to solve it.‚Äù</quote></h2>
                            <h4>What I‚Äôm looking for:</h4>
                            <p>My ideal job offers the chance to learn on lots of parts of software development, front/back end, middleware, databases, UX, accessibility ‚Äì I want to try everything and find where I fit.</p>
                            <p>I‚Äôd like to work in a team that trusts its developers / demonstrates or wants to grow in XP values, Agile works for them, loves TDD‚Ä¶ My dream job uses continuous deployment and isn‚Äôt scared to deploy on Fridays.</p>
                            <p>My ideal team should see the value in a diversity; creates opportunities for learning, mentorship; and continues their diversity throughout the business. Work/life balance is important and I would love to work somewhere that is proven to be kind about human needs. I‚Äôd like to be able to understand what the company does and believe in their product/values</p>
                            <h4>Strengths:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>README Queen: I pay special attention to writing code that can be understood as I want my code to be easy for the next dev to understand and be ‚Äòmalleable‚Äô.</li>
                                <li>Excellent collaborator (through pair programming) and communicator. Great at giving and receiving feedback!</li>
                                <li>I volunteer at codebar as a moderator and recently joined them as a London organiser. I like to go to meet ups and conferences, I went to CityJS conference during the pre-course and will be going to State of the Browser in Sept.</li>

        <h3>Codebar Stories</h3>
        <h1>Ruth Baker ‚Äî Makers Fellow</h1>
            <p>Ruth is a Makers Fellow, transforming her career from science publishing to software development. She built her tech skills through open resources and by attending codebar events in London, and is now a moderator for virtual codebar.</p>
            <p>Ruth lives in Kent, UK, with her partner (also a dev!), and cat Pepper (not a dev!). She is a volunteer for the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, and her other interests include tap dance and ballet.</p>
            <details>

                            <p>You can find Ruth on the internet at:</p>
                            <p>@ruthmoog | Github | Website</p>
                            <p>. . .</p>
                            <h4>What did you want to be growing up?</h4>
                            <p>When I was very young I wanted to be a mounted police officer ‚Äî get paid to own a horse? Yes please. During my school years I wanted to be a choreographer, and at college I was considering a career as a sound engineer. I went on to work briefly in music events, then worked in STEM publishing for a decade.</p>
                            <h4>When did your interest in tech start?</h4>
                            <p>I was part of an online music community and I‚Äôd seen others making websites and followed their lead. I muddled together HTML pages by exploring view source and finding tips on the web, and I used free web hosts to make websites for my projects. I‚Äôd tinker with CSS on myspace. Strangely this loose knowledge was helpful in my non-tech career.</p>
                            <p>When I saw the potential that programming could have in my job it gave me a greater interest in learning to code, but the frustration of not being enabled to use tech in my job drove me to change career.</p>
                            <h4>How did you make the transition to being a developer?</h4>
                            <p>I already knew I had a technical way of thinking that was underused in my job. I spoke to developers, UX designers, tech managers about their jobs, and followed developers on Twitter. I considered transferring to the digital team in my company, but decided enrolling at Makers was a smart route instead. I researched what I needed to join their fellowship and how to make my candidacy watertight. It worked! I worked peripherally for a year or more on improving my coding ability, but I handed in my notice and became focussed on my new career about four months before an opportunity came up to join as a Fellow ‚Äî all that groundwork meant I was ready to apply as soon as the opportunity arose. I start the Fellowship this month.</p>
                            <h4>What was your first development job?</h4>
                            <p>A band I followed saw my myspace profile customisation and asked me to customise their myspace page (unpaid) for their record release ‚Äî so I did‚Ä¶ having learnt a thing or two about projects since then, I would not take such an overzealous approach today!</p>
                            <p>Actually collaborating with someone is a great way to quantify your skills, find knowledge gaps to guide learning, and practise communication with a client. You might also produce something wonderful to show off in your portfolio.</p>
                            <h4>What is your favourite thing about being a developer?</h4>
                            <p>The joy from succeeding after being completely stumped on a problem. I can‚Äôt be the only person who claps themselves when they‚Äôve made something work correctly?!</p>
                            <h4>How did you get involved with codebar?</h4>
                            <p>codebar was recommended to me by a colleague. Once I‚Äôd focussed on a career change, I chose to be outwardly accountable for my learning, and joining the tech community via codebar was a way to do that. I found that the support and the shared network of the coaches/students is so so valuable, and the hard work the organisers put in to fostering community makes it easy to feel welcome.</p>
                            <p>Around the time I left publishing, Charlotte Zhao was starting to grow the virtual codebar with an idea that the community can be open globally and around-the-clock, so I offered to help with the project. Charlotte was happy to have someone share her vision and, I‚Äôm glad I volunteered!</p>
                            <h4>Why do you keep coming back to codebar?</h4>
                            <p>It‚Äôs fun, rewarding and an effective way to grow skills. Aside from working towards a coding goal, just by pairing with someone you can learn cool keyboard shortcuts and become a better technical communicator. At irl meetups you get a peek at the work environment at companies like Google and Deliveroo too. At virtual sessions you can have a remote working experience, and try out conferencing tools.</p>
                            <h4>What are your plans for the future?</h4>
                            <p>When I finish Makers I‚Äôll have a full-time developer role for at least a year with a corporate partner. That first job after completing the course will be full-on, and I intend to get experience across as much technology as humanly possible during that time. I will continue to learn the trade and refine my technique within my team, and later in whatever projects I end up working on down the line. Part of the ethos of being a developer is sharing, and coaching others is part of that. It‚Äôs exciting to think I can give others a leg-up and help make the tech environment more diverse and inclusive.</p>
                            <h4>What advice would you give to aspiring developers?</h4>
                            <p>Trust yourself ‚Äî You know what path is right for you; let yourself be supported by the tech community; do your best.</p>
                            <p>Know your direction ‚Äî Speak to people about their jobs, their team, their experience; ask yourself if you‚Äôre comfortable being a lifelong student; do good, be forward thinking, be kind.</p>
                            <p>Make things ‚Äî Get set up and start making real things, it works wonders!</p>
                            <h4>What is the bravest thing you‚Äôve ever done?</h4>
                            <p>I don‚Äôt think I am brave, but I have done some pretty fun things! As a dancer, I‚Äôve performed at a French cabaret, improvised with live jazz bands in New York and London, and shared a stage with Dizzee Rascal and Tim Berners-Lee at the London Olympics (weird but true‚Ä¶). I am guarded about strangers seeing my shopping at the supermarket checkout, so that‚Äôs quite an achievement, isn‚Äôt it? :)</p>
