        <h2>My values.</h2>

        <p>I believe in accessibility as a core principle when creating software. My digital community values diversity, collaboration, openness and reflection; its developers build relevant, satisfying software that's easy for everyone to use.</p>

        <p>On the web's 30th birthday, to demonstrate my support of the principles for an open web for everyone I signed the World Wide Web Foundation's <a href="https://fortheweb.webfoundation.org/principles">Contract for the Web</a>. In my capacity as a professional developer, I promise to abide by the ethical principles stated in the <a href="https://manifesto.responsiblesoftware.org/">Manifesto for Responsible Software Development</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm a Green Software practitioner and member of the Green Software Foundation community, whose mission is to create a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling, and best practices for building software.</p>

        <p>I volunteer for the <a href="https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a> as a Bee Walker.  The Trust coordinates a citizen science project where non-scientists (like me!) collect data on the abundance of bee species throughout the UK.  Taking part gives me the opportunity to explore the wildlife where I live.</p>

        <p>Before I became a developer, I had a decade-long career in STEM publishing. I have a strong background outside of technology as an operations team lead, and a project coordinator for print and digital products.</p>
